# Boxing Stance Coach (Beta)

Hey guys, this is a small segment of a larger project I am trying to create where anyone can learn the basic fundamentals of boxing. With this code you will be bale to utilize a virtual boxing coach that leverages MediaPipe to help achieve a perfect boxing stance.
Thus is my first attempt at bulding a virutal boxing coach, and any or all feedback would be greatly appreciated! 


## Features

- Guides users to align with the ideal boxing stance through 5 steps:

  1) Pose alignment
  2) Feet alignment
  3) Foot angle postioning
  4) Knee bend checker
  5) Hand placement position
     
- Provides real-time feedback throughout all the different steps 
- Uses MediaPipe for pose detection and all code is written through python 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kingsarthucodes/Boxing-Stance-Coach-beta-.git
